        "$\\gamma$ is a very important parameter for both of our reinforcement learning networks. Here, I selected 5 different values for $\\gamma$ ranges from 0 to 1 to test on both a deep Q-learning network and a SARSA network. Based on the results, we can see that both networks could solve the problem only when $\\gamma$ is exactly equal to 1. We know that $\\gamma = 1$ means that the agent cares about long-term rewards. A relatively small $\\gamma$ value (< 0.5) produces stable poor performance since the agent learns very slowly and could not find a solution in the given time. If we increase the value, the stability of output becomes worse, as we can see from the outputs have a wider range. Also, in general, SARSA is more stable than DQN and could run faster."

Based on the test results, unlike $\\gamma$, the agents could solve the problem with different initial values of $\\epsilon$ ($\\epsilon$ has a exponential decay term), so it is not as critical as $\\gamma$ for our RL models to find a solution in given time. More specifically, I assume that an initial $\\epsilon$ value that is larger than 0.5 seems reasonable since both agents perform well in this case, and also run faster."
