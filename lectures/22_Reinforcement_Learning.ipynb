    "### Recap of Supervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous lectures, we've primarily concerned ourselves with supervised learning problems (mostly classification).\n",
    "In supervised learning, we are given some sort of training data consisting of input/output pairs, with the goal being to be able to predict the output given some new inputs after learning the model.\n",
    "For example, a previous homework was on a CNN classification model for MNIST; given a training set of 55000 digit images and corresponding digit labels (e.g. '5'), we learned a model that was capable of predicting the digit label of new MNIST images.\n",
    "In order words, something like (but not exactly) this:\n",

    "### Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "Enter Reinforcement Learning. \n",
    "In Reinforcement Learning, our model (commonly referred to as an *agent* in this context) interacts with an *environment* by taking *actions* $a$ and receives some sort of feedback from the environment in the form of a *reward* $r$. \n",
    "In this sense, reinforcement learning algorithms learn by experience.\n",
    "We call the trajectory of going from start to finish of a task an *episode*, and often our agent will learn by undergoing many episodes.\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/RL.PNG\" alt=\"RL\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)\n",
    "Many reinforcement learning algorithms are modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). \n",
    "In these settings, we have a concept of a *state* $s$, which encapsulates the situation of the agent (e.g. location, velocity).\n",
    "From each state $s_t$, the agent takes an action $a_t$, which results in a transition from one state $s_t$ to another $s_{t+1}$.\n",
    "In many settings, there is stochasticity in this transition, meaning that there's is a distribution over $s_{t+1}$ conditioned on $s_t$ and $a_t$.\n",
    "Often, several of these states are considered episode ending, after which the agent can no longer make any transitions or collect any more reward.\n",
    "These correspond to states such as reaching the final goal, a game concluding, or falling off a cliff.\n",
    "In the end, our goal is to learn a *policy* $\\pi$, or a mapping from states to actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)\n",
    "In an MDP, we assume that we can always tell which state $s_t$ our agents is in.\n",
    "However, this isn't always the case.\n",
    "Sometimes, all we have access to are observations $o_t$ that provide information the state $s_t$, but enough to precisely pinpoint the exact one.\n",
    "We call such settings Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs).\n",
    "Imagine for example a [Roomba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roomba) being trained to navigate a living room with RL.\n",
    "From its infrared and mechanical \"bump\" sensors, it receives partial information ($o_t$) as to where it might be, but not a definitive location ($s_t$).\n",
    "Operating as a POMDP adds a whole layer of complexity to RL algorithms.\n",
    "For the rest of day though, we'll focus on MDPs, as their much simpler and easier to use to teach basic concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A simple MDP example\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Figures/MDP.png\" alt=\"MDP\" style=\"width: 400px;\"/>\n",
    "<center>Figure from *[Markov decision process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_decision_process)*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above example, we can see the 3 possible states for the agent as $s_0$, $s_1$, and $s_2$, with 2 actions $a_0$ and $a_1$ available from each state.\n",
    "We can see that the each action doesn't lead to a determinstic transition to the next state, as shown by multiple paths from each action. \n",
    "Note that each of the outcomes of an action are labeled with a small black number between 0 and 1.\n",
    "This denotes the probability of that outcome (which state we end up at) given the the action; as these are probabilites, the sum of the probabilities of arriving at each of the next states $s_{t+1}$ given a previous state $s_t$ and selected action $a_t$ is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the agent is to maximize the total reward $R$ it can receive over some number of steps.\n",
    "It is important to ensure the reward actually captures the true goal we want the agent to achieve.\n",
    "The agent will dutifully attempt maximize the objective it is given, without any considerations to any implicit objectives that a human may desire.\n",
    "There are more than a few (amusing) anecdotes of RL agents learning undesirable behaviors by exploiting some aspect of the reward function.\n",
    "As such, defining this reward requires special care.\n",
    "\n",
    "One countermeasure commonly deployed by RL researchers is the concept of *discounted* rewards.\n",
    "This is done with a multiplicative term $\\gamma$: a reward $T$ steps in the future is discounted as $\\gamma^T r_T$.\n",
    "Using discounting encourages the agent to finish the task sooner rather than later, a common implicit criterion.\n",
    "With discounting then, the RL agent's goal is to maximize:\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mathbb{E}[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r_t]\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "This is far from the complete solution to making our rewards accurately capture our desired objectives, but achieving higher rewards sooner rather than later is an almost universal preference, so we almost always add it.\n",
    "Designing a good reward function can be an art is highly dependent on the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Reinforcement Learning as Supervised Learning?\n",
    "At first, this doesn't seem too different from the supervised methods we've looked at before, and some natural questions might arise:\n",
    "- Why can't we just treat RL as a supervised task? \n",
    "Why can't we use the reward (or rather, the negative of the reward) as our supervised loss?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in supervised learning, in reinforcement learning, we often don't have a pre-apportioned dataset to learn from.\n",
    "In some problems set-ups, we may have examples of other agents (oftentimes humans) performing the desired task, but these aren't necessarily optimal examples of how to maximize the reward, which is what we want to learn.\n",
    "In most RL settings, we don't have any examples of state-action trajectories beyond what our agent experiences through trial-and-error, which are even more suboptimal. \n",
    "Learning from the reward signal itself is also not the way to do it, as such an approach would be myopic: it would maximize reward that can be earned now instead of maximizing the overall reward over a trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open AI Gym\n",
    "Before we dive any deeper into implementing reinforcement learning models, first we need an environment.\n",
    "Remember, the goal is to learn an agent that can interact with an environment in the way we want, so we need something that our agent can interact with and receive rewards from.\n",
    "In robotics, this is often the real world (or some set-up in the real world).\n",
    "However, it is oftentimes cheaper and quicker to first test our algorithms in simulated settings.\n",
    "There are a number of tasks that are popular benchmarks for the reinforcement learning community, such as [cart pole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_pendulum), [mountain car](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_car_problem), or [Atari 2600 games](https://gym.openai.com/envs/#atari). \n",
    "In the spirit of accelerating progress and promoting openness in the research community, Open AI has very nicely coded up [Open AI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/), which has implementations of many of these environments for public use.\n",
    "We will be using these environments, as it allows us to focus on the algorithms themselves, instead of worrying about implementing each problem setting ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use it, we first need to download and install it. Make sure you're in your TensorFlow environment first!\n",
    "\n",
    "```Shell\n",
    "# If you environment isn't currently active, activate it (include the word \"source\", without [] if on Mac or Linux):\n",

    "\n",
    "> *Winter is here. You and your friends were tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is slippery, so you won't always move in the direction you intend.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A visualization of FrozenLake as a grid world:\n",
    "\n",

    "<center>Figure from *[Frozen Lake: Beginners Guide To Reinforcement Learning With OpenAI Gym](https://analyticsindiamag.com/openai-gym-frozen-lake-beginners-guide-reinforcement-learning/)*</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "At the start of an episode, we begin in the upper left corner (S).\n",
    "Our goal is to move ourself to the lower right corner (G), avoiding falling into the holes (H).\n",
    "Icy water is cold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In reinforcement learning terms, each of the 16 locations on the grid are a state, and an action is attempting to move in one of four directions (left, down, right, up).\n",
    "Each move will result in the agent's state changing from $s_t$ to $s_{t+1}$ as it changes location, unless it attempts to move in the direction of a wall, which results in the agent's state not changing (the agent doesn't move).\n",
    "We receive a positive reward of \"+1\" for reaching the goal (G), discounted according to how long it took.\n",
    "While there is not a negative reward for falling into a hole (H), the agent still pays a penalty in the sense that falling into the hole is episode-ending and therefore prevents it from receiving any reward. \n",
    "We want to learn a policy $\\pi$ that takes us from our starting location (S) to the goal (G) in as few steps as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To really establish what we are trying to accomplish here, it's worth debunking a few common initial misconceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge of the states and transition probabilties:** From the top-down view, your first thought might be to plot out a path from the start to the finish, just as you would with a maze.\n",
    "However, this view is provided to us the algorithm designers so we can visualize the problem at hand.\n",
    "The agent learning the task does *not* get this prior knowledge; all we are about to tell it is that there are going to be 16 states and 4 possible actions from each state.\n",
    "A more proper analogy would be if I blindfolded you and dropped you in the middle of a frozen lake, and told you your state (location) every time you decided to take a step in one of four directions, then set off fireworks when you stepped on the frisbee.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Knowledge of the goal (reward):** In OpenAI's official description of the environment, you (the agent) know what you're hoping to accomplish: You want to retrieve the frisbee, while avoiding falling through the ice.\n",
    "The agent does *not* know this.\n",
    "Rather, it learns the goal by experiencing rewards (or penalties), and the algorithm updates its policy such that it will be more (or less) likely to do those actions again.\n",
    "Note that this means that if an agent never experiences certain rewards, it won't know they exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Prior knowledge of pathfinding, physics, etc.:** As a human, even if you haven't solved this task before, you still bring a tremendous amount of prior knowledge to this problem.\n",
    "For example, you know the shortest path to a destination is a line.\n",
    "You know that North, South, East, and West, are directions, and that going North and then South brings you back to where you already were.\n",
    "You know ice is slippery.\n",
    "You know icy water is cold.\n",
    "You know being in icy cold water is bad.\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind that our agent will begin knowing none of these things; it's initial policy is essentially picking actions completely at random.\n",
    "By the end of the training, it still won't know what abstract concepts like \"North/South,\" \"cold,\" or \"slippery\" mean\\*, but it will have (hopefully) learned a good policy that allows it to complete the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\* *Apologies. Didn't mean to get philosophical.*\n",

    "#### Interacting with FrozenLake\n",

    "Hm. \n",
    "Not great. \n",
    "Alright, so clearly picking random steps isn't very likely to take us to the goal.\n",
    "It's apparent just from looking at the map that there're much better policies that we can learn.\n",
    "How are we going to do so?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q-learning\n",
    "There are many algorithms that we can use, but let's choose Q-learning, which we've previously learned about in lecture.\n",
    "Remember, in Q-learning (and SARSA, it turns out), we're trying learn the Q values for the states in our system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q value for a policy $\\pi$ is a function of the state $s$ and action $a$ and is defined as the following:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q_\\pi (s,a) = \\mathbb{E}\\big[\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^t r_t \\big|\\pi, s_0 = s, a_0 = a\\big]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Intuitively, the Q value is the total reward (including discounting) that the agent will gain if it takes action $a$ from state $s$ and then follows policy $\\pi$ for the rest of the episode.\n",
    "As one might expect, if Q is known exactly, the agent will attain the highest reward from $s$ if the policy $\\pi$ is to pick the $a$ with the highest Q value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, so if we know the Q values for the system, then we can trivially find the optimal policy.\n",
    "So what are the Q values of the system?\n",
    "Well, at the beginning, we don't know, but we can try to learn them through experience.\n",
    "This is where Q-learning comes in.\n",
    "Q-learning iteratively updates the Q values in the following way:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "Q_\\pi (s_t, a_t) \\leftarrow (1 - \\alpha) \\cdot Q_\\pi(s_t, a_t) + \\alpha \\cdot \\big(r_t + \\gamma \\max_a Q_\\pi(s_{t+1}, a)\\big)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "Notice that Q-learning is an *off-policy* method, in the sense that you don't actually learn from the trajectory you actually took (otherwise it'd be SARSA).\n",
    "Instead, we learn from the *greedy* transition, i.e. the best action we know how to take.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it! \n",
    "We run our agent through many episodes, experiencing many $s_t \\rightarrow a_t \\rightarrow s_{t+1}$ transitions and rewards, and just like that, we eventually learn a good Q function (and thus a good policy).\n",
    "Now of course, there are a bunch of small details and tweaks to make this work in practice, but we'll get to those later.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Q-learning in FrozenLake\n",
    "FrozenLake is a very simple setting, one that we would call a toy problem.\n",
    "With only 16 states and 4 actions, there are only 64 state-action pairs possible (16x4=64), less if we account for the goal and the holes being episode ending (for simplicity though, we won't). \n",
    "With this few state-action pairs, we can actually solve this problem tabularly.\n",
    "Let's set up a Q table, and initialize the Q-values for all state-action pairs to zeros.\n",
    "Note that we're actually not going to need TensorFlow in this example; we'll use a Numpy array to store the Q table."

    "Hey, not bad.\n",
    "However, while the previous example was fun and simple, it was noticeably lacking any hint of TensorFlow.\n",
    "After all, this is supposed to be a TensorFlow session, so we should probably remedy that.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could have used a TensorFlow `Variable` to store the Q table and added the appropriate update ops to our computation graph, but that's a rather contrived way to force TensorFlow into the problem.\n",
    "TensorFlow's true utility comes from building neural networks and calculating/applying gradients automatically, which learning the Q table didn't need. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continuous domains\n",
    "In our previous example, we mentioned that with only 16 discrete states and 4 actions/state, the Q table only needed to hold 64 values, which is very manageable.\n",
    "However, what if the state or action space is continuous?\n",
    "You could discretize it, but then you have to pick a resolution, and your state-action space could explode exponentially.\n",
    "Treating these binned states or actions as completely different states is also ignoring that two consecutive bins are likely very similar in the needed policy.\n",
    "You can learn these relationships, but doing so is horriby sample inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of learning a Q table then, perhaps a Q function would be more appropriate.\n",
    "This function would take in a state and action as an input and return a Q value as an output.\n",
    "The Q function may be very complex, but as we've learned over the past few days, neural networks are very flexible and good for approximating arbitrary functions.\n",
    "Such an approach is called a [Deep Q Network](https://deepmind.com/research/dqn/)."
